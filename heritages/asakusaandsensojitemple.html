                    Story and Legends</u></h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Legend of the Kannon Statue: According to legend, Sensoji Temple was founded in 628 AD when two fishermen, Hinokuma 
                Hamanari and his brother Hinokuma Takenari, discovered a small golden statue of the Bodhisattva Kannon (the Goddess of 
                Mercy) in the nearby Sumida River. Despite repeatedly casting their nets into the river, they could only retrieve the 
                statue. Recognizing its divine significance, they enshrined it in a small temple, which later expanded to become 
                Sensoji Temple. This legend is the basis for the temple's popular nickname, "Asakusa Kannon."The Thunder Gate, or 
                Kaminarimon, is the outer gate leading to Sensoji Temple. It is famous for its massive paper lantern and imposing 
                statues of the Shinto gods Raijin (God of Thunder) and Fujin (God of Wind). According to legend, during the Edo period,
                 a thunder god descended to Earth and left behind the massive lantern as a gift to Sensoji Temple. The gate was named 
                 after this event and has since become an iconic symbol of Asakusa.
