                    Historical Highlights</u></h2>
            <br>
            <p>The date of establishment of the Hie Shrine is uncertain. According to one theory, ≈åta D≈çkan established it in 1478. Another theory identifies the Hie with the Sann≈ç Shrine mentioned in a 1362 record of the Kumano Nachi Taisha.<br><br>

                Tokugawa Ieyasu relocated it to the grounds of Edo Castle, and in 1604 his son Tokugawa Hidetada moved it out, so the people of Edo could worship there. The shaden was lost to the Great Fire of Meireki of 1657, and in 1659 Tokugawa Ietsuna rebuilt it at its present location. The shrine stands southwest of the castle, in the ura kimon direction according to onmy≈çd≈ç.<br>
