                Imperial Palace Tokyo: In-Depth Historical Site Data<br>

                <br>Edo Castle Era (1437 - 1868)<br>
                
                <br>Founding: Built in 1437 by Ota Dokan, a powerful warlord.
                Tokugawa Shogunate: In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate, began a massive expansion and renovation project that transformed Edo Castle into a sprawling complex. Over the next 120 years, his successors continued the project, creating the largest castle in the world at the time.
                Key Structures: The castle boasted a central keep (donjon), numerous gates (including the iconic Hishi-no-mon Gate), vast inner and outer baileys (courtyards), and elaborate residential and administrative buildings.
                Materials: Primarily constructed from wood, with stone foundations and some fortifications.
                Fires and Rebuilding: The castle suffered from several major fires throughout its history, with significant destruction in 1657. The Tokugawa shoguns undertook extensive rebuilding efforts each time.
                
                
                <br><br>Imperial Palace Era (1868 - Present)
                
                <br>Meiji Restoration: In 1868, with the overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate, Emperor Meiji moved his court to Edo Castle, renaming it the Imperial Palace.
                Great Fire of 1873: A disastrous fire swept through the palace complex, destroying most of the Edo-era structures.
                New Palace Construction (1888): A new palace complex was built in a more Western-influenced style, incorporating some fire-resistant materials. This is the core of the present-day Imperial Palace.
                20th Century Destruction and Reconstruction: Air raids during World War II heavily damaged the palace buildings. The current ferro-concrete structures were completed in the 1960s, blending traditional Japanese aesthetics with modern earthquake resistance.<br>

            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>The inner grounds of the palace are generally not open to the public. Only on January 2 (New Year's Greeting) and February 23 (Emperor's Birthday), visitors are able to enter the inner palace grounds and see the members of the Imperial Family, who make several public appearances on a balcony.
                Furthermore, guided tours of the palace grounds are offered during the rest of the year, although no buildings are entered. The tours take about 75 minutes and are held in English and Japanese daily at 10:00 and 13:30 except on Mondays, Sundays and national holidays. Advance reservations can be made through the Imperial Household Agency (see links below), but same-day registrations before the start of the tours are also possible at the Kikyomon Gate.
