                    Historical Highlights</u></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Tokyo Tower's construction began in 1957 and was completed in 1958. It was designed by architect Tach≈´ Nait≈ç and built 
                by the Takenaka Corporation.Upon its completion, Tokyo Tower stood as the tallest structure in Japan, surpassing the 
                Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. It reached a height of 333 meters (1,092 feet). At the time, it was the second 
                tallest man-made structure in the world, after the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which served as its inspiration. Tokyo Tower 
                was built to serve as a broadcasting tower for radio and television signals. Its height was necessary to overcome the 
                challenges posed by Tokyo's dense urban landscape, ensuring widespread broadcast coverage.</p>
